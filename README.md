Getting Started with WSGI
=========================

# Why this book?

`WSGI` is a great component in [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/). Understanding `WSGI` gives you the knowledge base you need to understand the code behind other popular projects, such as `Neutron`, `Django`, `Flask`, and `CherryPy`.

# Translations

The first version will be `Chinese`, but other translations are in the works. We're planning an `English` translation in the future.
